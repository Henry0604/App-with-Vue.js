# App-with-Vue.js
This repository aims to create an application for calculating tips among several people, allowing input of the total bill, the number of people, and the tip percentage to calculate the tip amount. All of this is developed in the Vue.js framework.

## Introduction
This app, as mentioned earlier, aims to facilitate the calculation of the total bill and tip that may arise from a restaurant or establishment, allowing the user to input the necessary data and select those who covered their share.
